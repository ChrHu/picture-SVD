This is an erxercise for the course advanced linear algebra taught by Friedrich Eisenbrand at the EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland.
It is meant to show how well a picture can be approximated by computing its singular value decomposition and only using the first r singular values (and vectors of the unitary matrices) to restore the image.
